				<p>Web development is something that I've always had an affinity to. Since 2010, I've taken 
				the opportunity to get some real-world experience in my spare time. Since this is basically a hobby for me, 
				I've used a service-for-service model for payment, rather than cash-for-service. My clients have appreciated this; 
				they are small business owners, and it's one less thing for them to worry about!</p>

					  <p>My client already had a website, but she was unhappy with the design of it, and her web designer could not be reached.
					  <br>Since my children attended the daycare, I volunteered to give it a shot. I designed this website; her requirements
					  were basically "keep it clean and simple", and she loved it.
					   <br>The next step was to find a webspace provider. I chose <a href="ipage.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipage.com</a> and got the website up and live.
					   <br>After it was live, I continued to maintain the website, including formatting the summer programs in PowerPoint, adding the testimonials 
					   on the left panel, and adding a photo album that used Lightbox.</p>
					   <p><strong>Technologies used: </strong>
					   <br /> - HTML
					   <br /> - CSS
					   <br /> - Lightbox 
					   <br /> - JavaScript</p>

					<div id="atb_mk2_more" class="collapse">
					  <p>I decided that building a mobile-friendly website from scratch would be too much for me, as I'm still figuring out how to make
					  beautiful websites as I go; so I used a template. I searched for free mobile-friendly website templates, and came 
					  across <a href="http://bootstraptaste.com/demo/Squadfree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one.</a> As you can see, some extensive work was done to 
					  investigate the design, change the color scheme, add the data, incorporate custom staff pop-ups, and add other needed components.</p>
					  <p>My client was extremely happy with the upgrade!</p>

					<p>My client for After The Bell raved about my services to her esthetician, who operated a home business, and needed a website.</p>

					<div id="richardson" class="collapse">
					  <p>I used the same philosophy for this website as I did for ATB mark II. I used a template and modified it to suit the clients needs.
					  <br>I didn't show her the template to begin with, and it turned out that that was a very good thing! She was so pleased with the end result, 
					  but admitted that she would've had a hard time envisioning it with 
					  <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-casual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">this template</a>.</p>
					  <p>There were a few teething problems with this website as well; there wasn't one already in existence, so I had to go to Google and find out 
					  how to configure it to show up in Google search results. The configuration still isn't perfect, but it's closer!</p>
					  <p>Adding Richardson Esthetics to my existing webspace provider gave me the opportunity to reorganize my webspace to allow for multiple websites.</p>
					  <p>Due to unforeseen incidents, however, Richardson Esthetics is no longer in business.</p>

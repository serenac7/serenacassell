				<p>Web development is something that I've always had an affinity to. Since 2010, I've taken
				the opportunity to get some real-world experience in my spare time. Since this is basically a hobby for me,
				I've used a service-for-service model for payment, rather than cash-for-service. My clients have appreciated this;
				they are small business owners, and it's one less thing for them to worry about!</p>

					<div id="richardson" class="collapse">
					  <p>I used the same philosophy for this website as I did for ATB mark II. I used a template and modified it to suit the clients needs.
					  <br>I didn't show her the template to begin with, and it turned out that that was a very good thing! She was so pleased with the end result,
					  but admitted that she would've had a hard time envisioning it with
					  <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/business-casual/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this template</a>.</p>
					  <p>There were a few teething problems with this website as well; there wasn't one already in existence, so I had to go to Google and find out
					  how to configure it to show up in Google search results. The configuration still isn't perfect, but it's closer!</p>
					  <p>Adding Richardson Esthetics to my existing webspace provider gave me the opportunity to reorganize my webspace to allow for multiple websites.</p>
					  <p>Due to unforeseen incidents, however, Richardson Esthetics is no longer in business.</p>

					<p>My son is in the Sea Cadets, and to stay involved, I managed the content for their website. This was my first exposure to WordPress.
					<br />Unfortunately, the person I communicated with ended their term and my information got lost until someone else decided to take on the 
					content management and asked me to port it over to their host, so I no longer have access to the site, and no longer maintain it. It's still 
					worth having here for the exposure to WordPress however!</p>

									<h1>Mandy (Owner/Operator)</h1>
									<p>Hi, my name is Mandy and I am the Program Owner and founder of After The Bell Inc since 2006. I'm also one of the 
									   Supportive Child Care Workers in the center. I have
									   worked with school-aged children for the past 16 years in all aspects of their care. I am the mother of a school-age
									   boy who loves playing hockey and spending time with his friends. So if I am not at the center, you will find
									   me at the rink or organizing play dates.
									<br>I started my career in Edmonton, AB where I gained extensive experience managing and operating school-aged child 
									   care facilities. In 2004 I was blessed with the birth of my son and felt it was necessary for him to be raised 
									   knowing his family, so we relocated back to Nova Scotia. My staff and I look forward to working with you and 
									   your family to ensure your child has the most positive experience at After The Bell Inc.</p>

								<h1>Lorraine (Staff)</h1>
								<p>Hi, my name is Lorraine and I am the Program Co-Ordinator for the younger kids program and have been an 
								employee here for almost 4 years. Here at After The Bell Inc. I have worked with children of all ages and in many 
								roles, and although I have worked at other licenced centres in our city my heart belongs with After The Bell Inc. 
								I believe it is important to continue my education in the Early Childhood Education field and find it extremely 
								rewarding to share what I have learned with other staff members at After The Bell Inc. I also work at Cole Harbour 
								Place so you may have seen me hosting a birthday party or in the babysitting room. I enjoy singing and the outdoors; 
								family and friends are also a big part of my life. I truly love working with children, it comes naturally to me and 
								I enjoy every minute of my job!</p>

								very excited to continue my journey as an Early Childhood Educator at After the Bell Inc. 
								<br>I have two younger sisters and a four year old niece who is a joy to be around. Through my previous experience, I 
								know that working with children is what I most love to do and I know that After the Bell Inc. is a wonderful and rewarding 
								place to do that.</p>

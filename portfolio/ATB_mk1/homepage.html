	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<p>Welcome to After The Bell Inc. This website was developed to provide parents with an understanding 
	   of how the center operates. If you have any questions, comments or concerns please follow the Contact 
	   link to speak with any of the After The Bell Inc. employees.</p>
	<br>
	<p>After The Bell Inc. is dedicated to providing high quality childcare for children between the ages of 4-12 years. </p>
	<!--br>
	<p class="important">Cancellations go here!</p -->
	<br>
	<h1>Inclement Weather Policy</h1>
	<p>This policy can basically be boiled down to three points:
	<br> - If buses are cancelled, then After The Bell Inc is open, but the van will not be running.
	<br> - If schools are closed before they start, then After The Bell Inc is open.
	<br> - If schools are closed part way through the day, then After The Bell is closed, and you will have to make arrangements to pick up your children.</p>
	<p>The only exception to this is if the school board identifies at the beginning of the day that the schools will be closing mid-day, After The Bell 
	will be open; this is because with enough notice, we can make sure that there are enough staff on hand when the schools are closed.</p>
	<p>For your peace of mind, and for the safety of all your children, we made sure that the van got brand new studded tires this year!</p>
	<br>
	<h1>Center Updates</h1>
	<p> - We are aware that the children have not been getting as much outdoor-time as they should be. Hopefully this month will be a bit nicer, and we can 
	all get a little more fresh air!</p>

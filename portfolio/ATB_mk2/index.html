					<p class="testimonial">"I chose After The Bell as I was tirelessly searching to secure after-school care in the  middle of the school year.
					After being told, I would be put on a wait list, and called back by several daycares, After the Bell was the only one who kept their word.
					In fact, the owner even held my spot due to bad weather as I had to drive 2 hours away to view the place, to see if it was 'the right fit'
					for my child.  It was then that I knew this would be the place, as Mandy was so accommodating and welcoming to both my child and I.  Upon
					the arrival, there were many happy looking children, and my daughter settled in immediately, and did not want to leave.
					<br />After the Bell offers a variety of options for fun, play and learning; all which are important skills in child development.
					Also since being at ATB, Mandy has provided an opportunity for the parents to get involved in the actions of how to better provide after
					school programming for school aged children.  They offer affordable rates, and most importantly, I drop my daughter off with ease and comfort,
					as she loves the friends she has made as well as the staff.  This program has allowed a much smoother transition for both my daughter and in in
					the middle of a school year, which we all know can be hectic, and we could not have been more grateful.

					<p class="testimonial">"My daughter has been at ATB since September 2015, when she first started in grade primary. Our family had wonderful
					experiences with daycare/preschool and I was very anxious about what the transition to public school would be like – for our whole family!
					<br />I remember looking for before/after school care for my daughter and being struck by the limited options available in our area. We knew
					Excel wouldn’t work for us given its limited schedule (no coverage on snow days, PD days, etc) and having our child in a licensed child care
					program was very important to us. I emailed Mandy in February 2015 to ask if our family could tour the centre. I was looking to set up a
					specific time to come in, but Mandy responded with “just stop by anytime, that way you can really get a sense of the program.”
					This response impressed me; it told me that Mandy was confident enough in her program and her staff that she didn’t need to “prepare” for tours –
					they were always ready! I remember my first impressions of ATB. I was pleased (and maybe a little surprised) with the number of staff
					working – I’m sure it was more than required under licensing – and how friendly and inviting each staff member was to us. They all interacted
					directly with my daughter and made her feel welcome and important; something that continues to this day. The biggest factor in our decision to
					register at ATB was that my daughter instantly loved it – she didn’t want to leave! (it is still a struggle to get her to come home at the end of
					the day.)
					<br />I could go on and on about the positive experiences we’ve had at ATB. The staff really care for the children and are invested in their
					well-being. My daughter adores the staff and has made wonderful friendships with the other children. I have also been impressed with the way Mandy
					interacts with me as a parent. She is open and transparent in her communication and I know I can come to her with any concerns I may have and that she
					will take immediate steps to address them. Mandy is always looking for ways to improve ATB and routinely seeks out parental feedback; which means
					so much to us as parents, that we have a real voice; that we are listened to. By far, the biggest benefit to being a part of the ATB family,
					is knowing that my child is happy, safe, and cared for. What more could a mother want!"</p>

					<p class="testimonial">"I would like to begin by saying from the first phone call to inquire about your services I was given nothing but quality
					Client Service Delivery and to this I will always be grateful. My first phone call was lengthy, many questions, concerns and uncertainty. This would
					be the 1st time to leave my only child with a child care provider that I didn't know (you came highly recommended) I didn't know the ever so patient
					person on the other end was the owner ;) who took the time to reassure me  "yes we have the proper ration child/ staff, yes the children play according
					to age, yes our staff are certified have all the correct documentation", etc etc; thank you for not brushing me off and showing patience to my many
					questions  ;) leaving your 4 year old with strangers is kind of a big deal ;)
					<br />My daughter has enjoyed every moment spent at ATB, she has made many wonderful friends as well as fallen in love with the warm and nurturing staff
					and maybe stolen their hearts ;) I am quite sure our paths will cross again in the future. Thank you all for your wonderful care and allowing this mother
					to work worry free knowing optimal care was being given to my daughter in my absence. My husband and I will be forever grateful to all of you for making

					<h3>Inclement Weather Policy</h3>
					<p align="left">The inclement weather policy can be boiled down to three points:
					   <br />    - If buses are cancelled, then After The Bell Inc is open, but the van will not be running.
					   <br />    - If schools are closed before they open for the day, then After The Bell Inc is open.
					   <br />    - If schools notify that they will be closing part way through the day, then After The Bell Inc is open.
					   <br />    - If schools are closed part way through the day, then After The Bell is closed, and you will have to make arrangements to pick up your children.
					 </p>

					<br />
					<br />

					<h3>No Pets Permitted</h3>
					<p>Pets are not permitted within the center. This is for the safety and security of the children. Service animals are not affected by the no-pets rule.</p>

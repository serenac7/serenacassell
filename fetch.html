				<p>While I was between positions in 2018, I started working on this site to help the owner. I had noticed that the existing website was difficult to navigate and had very out-dated information.
        <br />I proposed making changes to the owner, and allowed them to set the pace for change.</p>
        <p>The first challenge to overcome was finding a way to get the data from the existing site. The person who had maintained it was no longer available, so the files, images, and domain were not available.
        <br />The owner managed to register a new domain, and then transferred it over to me with direction so that I could keep it going and easily manage the site.</p>
        <p>Once that was sorted, I had to keep this project somewhat on the back burner; the owner needed to take care of some things during the pandemic and didn't have time to review the website.</p>

				  <p>When I realized that the owner was having a hard time getting the volume of information, I scaled back the website to contain only what they needed.</p>
          <p>Once that was finished and updates that were needed to update the prices and class descriptions were completed, it took less than a week to get sign off and bring the site live.</p>
